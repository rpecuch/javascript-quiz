# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to apply JavaScript and web API fundamentals to build a coding quiz application. During the development process, I learned how to apply document object methods and properties, utlilize event handlers, alter attributes of HTML elements using JavaScript, and write more complex JavaScript functions than I was previously able to. Furthermore, this application serves as a practice tool for technical assessments. In the near future I plan on refactoring this application using React to allow the user to choose from multiple different quiz topics.
