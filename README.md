# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to apply JavaScript and web API fundamentals to build a coding quiz application. During the development process, I learned how to apply document object methods and properties, utlilize event handlers, alter attributes of HTML elements using JavaScript, and write more complex JavaScript functions than I was previously able to. During the debugging process, I learned from my mistakes and became exposed to multiple ways to accomplish the same task.

Furthermore, this application serves as a practice tool for technical assessments. As I cover more topics in class, I will continue to update this application with more content.
